                 <h3>Some New Faces!</h3>
                 <p>As the college semester winds down, some of our veteran employees will be returning to the ranks! As such, you'll likely
                 be seeing quite a few new (or maybe familiar!) faces over the next few weeks. We want to congratulate our 
                 college age employees for making it through another school year. Please join us in welcoming them back home!</p>
