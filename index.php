        <!--General restaurant info-->
        <p class = 'indent'>The Summer House is a family restaurant located in Southwick, MA. We serve up all your favorites, from burgers to sandwiches to ice cream. 
            We even have homemade soups, made from scratch every day by our head chef and co-owner, Nick. Come grab lunch or dinner with your friends 
            or family, or maybe grab something to satisfy your sweet tooth. In addition to our limited-edition flavors, we carry ice cream flavors like
            cookies and cream, peppermint stick, and maple walnut, in addition to the classics, like vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Get any of 
            these delicious ice cream flavors in a shake, on a cone, or maybe in one of our specialty sundaes! Sundaes include the ever-popular hot 
            fudge, strawberry, strawberry shortcake, hot fudge brownie, peanut butter cup, and so many more! Whether you’re looking for something simple 
            and timeless, like a soft serve twist on a cake cone, or something a little more daring, like a coffee twist flurry with cookie dough and M&Ms
            (my personal favorite), the Summer House in Southwick is sure to deliver.</p>
        
        <p class = 'indent'>Don’t want to wait in line? Call ahead! We accept call in orders of any size, or you can walk in and order with one of our friendly servers 
            at the register. Come sit and enjoy your ice cream in our lovely indoor dining room, which is always decorated to match the seasons. Or, if 
            the weather is nice, enjoy any one of our outdoor picnic tables, our shaded gazebo, or even our wooden train set out back. Don’t have time 
            to sit and eat with us? No worries! In addition to to-go call in orders, we also do take-out orders of any size! Take out ice cream, food, 
            or both, and enjoy a little piece of the Summer House wherever you go!</p>
